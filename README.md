# INDE577 Final - Data Science and Machine Learning

### Instructor: Randy R. Davila

## Course Overview

This repository serves as the capstone project for INDE 577, guided by Professor Randy R. Davila. Throughout this course, we have explored an extensive array of topics within data science and machine learning, spanning supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The content here is the culmination of a semester's worth of dedicated study, featuring:

- **Practical Implementations:** Hands-on coding examples using Python to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world data.
- **Diverse Learning Paradigms:** Detailed explorations of different machine learning methodologies, each with its own directory containing specific examples and thorough documentation.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Each project segment incorporates data preprocessing, algorithmic application, and results discussion to foster a deep understanding of the tools and techniques used in data science.

We hope this repository not only demonstrates our learning and achievements but also serves as a valuable resource for others interested in the field of data science and machine learning.

## Repository Structure

Each algorithm subdirectory in this repository is organized to facilitate understanding and practical application of the machine learning techniques covered. Here is what each subdirectory contains:

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms develop models that make predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty, utilizing labeled datasets to train algorithms that can accurately map inputs to known outputs. Belows are the algorithms we have covered in this repo:

- **The Perceptron:** A foundational model in machine learning, the Perceptron is a simple yet powerful binary classifier that helps lay the groundwork for understanding more complex neural architectures.

- **Gradient Descent:** Essential for optimizing models, Gradient Descent iteratively adjusts parameters to minimize a specified loss function, crucial in training various types of machine learning models.

- **Linear Regression:** This technique models the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, providing a straightforward approach for predictive analysis.

- **Logistic Regression:** Widely used for classification tasks, Logistic Regression estimates the probabilities of binary outcomes based on input features.

- **Neural Networks:** Comprising layers of interconnected nodes, Neural Networks are capable of capturing complex patterns and relationships within large sets of data.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN is a non-parametric method that classifies data points based on the 'k' nearest labeled points in the feature space, emphasizing simplicity and effectiveness.

- **Decision Trees:** Decision Trees split the data into subsets using a tree-like model of decisions, making them intuitive and easy to interpret.

- **Ensemble Methods:** These methods combine multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.

In each own subdirectory, it provides an overview of each algorithm, highlighting their main characteristics and an example to show the role they play in machine learning.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves identifying patterns and relationships in datasets without pre-labeled outcomes. Here are three key algorithms we've explored:

- **K-Means Clustering:**
  K-Means is a clustering algorithm that partitions a set of data points into a predefined number of clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It is widely used for its simplicity and efficiency in grouping data.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  PCA reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset, making it easier to explore and visualize the data's underlying patterns.

- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):**
  DBSCAN is an algorithm that identifies arbitrarily shaped clusters and outliers in data, based on varying densities. It is particularly effective in data environments where the noise and the density of the points can vary significantly.
